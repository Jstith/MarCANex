## Current Features

* Secure password authentication / sessions
* List known CAN commands
* Query list for certain values
    * search strings
    * filter values
* Add/Remove/Edit commands

## Future Goals

* Send commands to CAN from app
* Craft multi-command injects
* mass database adds with CSV
